I’m **Chirag Patel** — Third Year Undergraduate, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Gandhinagar.

### 🔭 About me
I work at the intersection of software and finance. I enjoy building practical projects that turn market ideas into reproducible research and automated strategies.

### 🔥 Finance enthusiast
I’m deeply interested in financial markets and quantitative trading. I focus on:
- **Equities & Options** — valuation intuition, Greeks, volatility surface
- **Algorithmic trading** — strategy design, execution, and slippage-aware backtests
- **Risk management** — position sizing, stop logic, portfolio-level risk controls
- **Data & Research** — feature engineering, factor research, and event studies

### 🛠 Tools & languages
Python (pandas, numpy, backtrader), Pine Script (TradingView), basic experience with MetaTrader/MT5 and financial data APIs.

### ⭐ Projects (examples)
- `algo-backtest` — slippage-aware backtesting framework (Python)
- `pine-signal-suite` — indicators & signal scripts in Pine Script for TradingView
- `options-screener` — ideas for volatility-based option trades (not public yet)
